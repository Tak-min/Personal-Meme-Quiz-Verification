Project: Black History Login

Summary
A unique AI-powered authentication system where your embarrassing past memories ("black history") become your password. The Google Gemini API validates if your secret answers are creative and cringeworthy enough to serve as a login key.

Features

AI-Powered Validation: The AI judges the quality of your "black history," rejecting generic or common answers.

AI-Generated Recommendations: For users needing inspiration, the AI suggests original sets of secret questions and answers.

Exclusive AI Content: Upon successful login, the AI generates a personalized "Black History Poem" just for you.

Core Innovation: This project integrates AI not merely for content generation but into the core of its authentication logic. It transforms the act of logging in itself into a fun and interactive experience with AI.
